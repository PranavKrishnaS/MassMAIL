# The `T.A.S.K` System

The `T.A.S.K` system is MassMAIL's one of the most unique features
that allow it to be a highly customizable utility tool.

`1. Target` : 
This feature allows creation of large list like structures called `Bunches` that help in sending a common message. With the additional capabilities of duplicating these lists, `Target` needs to be fed the content to be sent, and the list of variables (if any) in a spreadsheet. `Target`'s intelligent detection assists in finding the datasheets you need or you can automatically add the column names of each variable. 

`2. Automate` : Create

`3. Send` : `Send` is the core functionality of MassMAIL. Offers features like HTML and CSS embedding, attachments

`4. Know` : Analytics on the e-mails and getting notifications of replies.
